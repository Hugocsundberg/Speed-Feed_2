#Speed Feed Social Network
##Overview
Speed Feed is a social network designed and created by myself with native PHP, JS and CSS.The project is hosted on Heroku with a Postgres database.  


##Design 
The idea with the design was to have a modern and soft UI that would implement elements of 'Frosted glass'. For this I utilized the 'backdrop-filter' css proporty. <br> I also believe in the design philosophy that nothing should come out of nowhere and nothing accelerates from 0-1 instantly. <br> 

I tried to follow those rules when i created a costom confirmation box class. 
![]() <br><br>
The box is rendered from JS when the 'createPopup' method is called upon. This method returns a promise which will resolve when the user presses the the confirmation button.
